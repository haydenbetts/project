Goal finish this by Saturday:

The first thing that we need is a good content management system (CMS) which actually allows hosts to create the pages.
The database will then store the actual content of the project page as well as the metadata associated with that page.
The template engine will then structure the data which the host inputs into a uniform format. In addition to the project
database we need a database for the users which stores their priveleges and hashed ids. Access Control Lists (ACL)
also occur here.

Goal finish this by Sunday:

Along with the backend CMS we need the html and css and jquery etc. which the user encounters upon first visiting the site. This needs
to have the login box (I think they explain how to do the login stuff on the cs50 wiki).

Goal finish this by Monday: 

Create page where the host can create projects.

Goal finish this by Tuesday:

Create page where user browses the existing projects.
